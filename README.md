For a full description see the [Wiki]( https://rimworld-bestiary.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_Ark)

Deep in rimspace, a science vessel was recently discovered. An ark vault containing thousands upon thousands of tissue samples from earth that was. Now that glitterworld bioengineers have gotten their hands on them, old earth species are once again seeding far off words.

So far they have reanimated a lot of cattle and sheep and pigs, more are yet to come. A badger and a gerbil has also been sighted as well as some sort of bird. These animals can be bought of traders although some has spread to the wild in some areas. Snakes and some sort of prickly mantis seem to be showing up as well.

Snakes venom glands can be harvested if using [Infectious Creatures](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1430501911)
Sheep drop sheepskin if using [Sheepskin](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2746519764)
